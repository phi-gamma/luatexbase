                    Changes in the luatexbase package/bundle

The [BI] tag signals backward-incompatible changes.
Starting with  v0.3, the only possible source of such changes is the upcoming
merge with luatex.sty. Afterwards, no other BI change is to be expected.

2011/05/21 v0.31
    attr
        - Bugfix: \unsetluatexattribute didn't work (reported by Dohyun Kim)

2010/10/10 v0.3
    all   not using LuaTeX results in an error (formerly a warning)
    modutils
        - [BI] \luatexUseModule and \luatexRequireModule replaced by
          \RequireLuaModule with a unified syntax.
        - [BI] luatexbase.use_module removed (use luatexbase.require_module with
          a single argument instead).
        - [BI] luatexbase.module_term removed.
        - [BI] removed support for version check using a floating point
          number, only date is supported now.
        - module_{error,warning,info,log} now apply string.format
          automatically
        - date, version and description are now optional.
        - improved formatting of messages.
        - luatexbase.require_module now returns curstom err/war/inf functions.
    mcb
        - [BI] rationalise "list"-type callbacks handling. The new calling
          convention differs from the old one only in edge cases.
        - add user documentation
        - misc code tuning (more locals, etc)

2010/10/04
    - various documentation updates/fixes uploaded to CTAN
    - luatexbase.sty used to be broken on CTAN (bad docstrip)

2010/05/27 v0.2a
    attr
        - allocate from 1 to avoid problems with some external code
        - provide a Lua interface: new_attribute() and unset_attribute().
    modutils
        - fix bug with module require_module()-ed many times.
    luatexbase
        - new, loads: compat,loader,regs,attr,cctb.

[BI] Summary of backwards-incompatible interface changes between 0.1 and 0.2:
    - Lua objects are now in table luatexbase, not luatextra.
    - Lua tables tex.attributenumber and tex.catcodetablenumber are not
      created any more, use their couterparts in luatexbase.
    - \luatexsetcatcoderange has been renamed to \setcatcoderange.
    - luamcallbacks has been renamed; Lua objects are now in luatexbase,
      no more in callback.* or luamcallbacks.*
    - module error/warning etc now apply string.format to the arguments.

        - test file now for plain and latex
    luatexbase-loader
        - require"foo.bar" now looks for foo/bar then foo.bar, see doc for
